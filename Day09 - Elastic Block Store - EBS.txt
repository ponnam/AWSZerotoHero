Elastic Block Store - EBS:
--------------------------


--> Amazon Elastic Block Store ( Amazon EBS) Provides Block level storage for EC2 instances as a VOLUME.

--> EBS Volumes available as RAW, Unformatted Disk

--> EBS volumes must be created with a filesystem (NTFS, EXT3, EXT4) to make the storage usable.

--> EBS volumes can be attached with the EC2 instances in the same AZ

--> ByDefault, We can attach the EBS volume to Single EC2 instance at a time.

--> EBS provides the below vategories of storage options

	a) Solid State Drive - SSD
	b) Hard Disk Drive - HDD
	c) Previous Generation Disk

--> SSD Storage Volumes, the dominant performance attribute is IOPS ( Input Output operations per Second)

--> HDD Storage volumes, the dominant performace attribute is Throughput (MB/s)


Types of Volumes:
-----------------

1. Root Volume --> Is the volume, in which the operating systems installed
2. EBS VOlume --> All other additional Volumes

Note: root volume will be deleted automatically along with the EC2 instance termination.
      EBS volumes, we have to delete manually after the Ec2 instance termination

NOTE: gp2, gp3 & Magentic are free tier eligible, upto 30GB per month


EBS Offers, different types of volumes for different use cases

	1. General Purpose SSD 
			- gp2
			- gp3
	
	2. Provisioned IOPS SSD
			- io1
			- io2

	3. Cold HDD  - sc1
	
	4. Throughput optimized HDD - st1

	5. Magnetic - standard (previous generation)


--> SSD harddisks will have the dominance performance of IOPS, where as the HDD'd dominance performance will be in throughput.


--> EBS volumes can be attached to the Instances, which are in the same Availability Zone

--> EBS volumes Cannot be attached to multiple instances at a time, instead volume can be detached from instance1 and attached to the instance2.


Note: Create 3 EC2 instances SERVER1A, SERVER2B & SERVER3A in 1a, 1b & 1a AZ respectively.



General Purpose SSD - gp2:
--------------------------

1. Create a 1GB EBS volume using gp2 type in us-east-1a AZ

	Durability			-	99.8% - 99.9%
	Min Size			-	1 GB
	Max Size			-	16 TB
	IOPS				-	Not Customizable
	IOPS Ratio			-	[1:3, GB:IOPS], with minimum of 100 IOPS
	MAX IOPS			-	16000 IOPS
	Throughput			-	Not Applicable, Upto 250 MB/s
	Free Tier			-	Yes, Upto 30GB per Month
	Boot/Root  Volume		-	Yes
	Multi-Attach			-	Not Supported

2. Create 2GB EBS volume using gp3 type in us-east-1a AZ

	Durability			-	99.8% - 99.9%
	Min Size			-	1 GB
	Max Size			-	16 TB
	IOPS				-	Can be customized
	IOPS Ratio			-	Upto [1:500, GB:IOPS], min of 3000 IOPS
	MAX IOPS			-	16000 IOPS
	Throughput			-	125 MB/s - 1000 MB/s   --> [1:4, MB/s:IOPS]
	Free Tier			-	Yes, Upto 30GB per Month
	Boot/Root  Volume		-	Yes
	Multi-Attach			-	Not Supported


3. Create 4GB EBS volume using io1 type in us-east-1b AZ

4. Create 6Gb EBS volume of io2 type in us-east-1c AZ

5. Create 125GB EBS volume using sc1 type in us-east-1b AZ

6. Create 130 GB EBS Volume using st1 type in us-east-1a AZ

7. Create 3GB EBS volume using standard type in us-east-1c



8. Attach the 1GB EBS volume to the SERVER1A EC2 instance, and observe it cannot be attached to the SERVER2B Instance (In a different AZ)


9. Login to SERVER1A and observe the 1GB VOlume as D Drive

	Username	: 
	Password	:
	Public IP	:

--> By Default, All new Hardware is in Offline mode
--> The new volume doesn't have any filesystem, we must create a partition along with the file system


10. Detach the 1GB volume from SERVER1A and attach ot to the SERVER3A and observe all 10 files exists.

	- Make the Volume Online
