EBS Volume Management:
=======================

--> We can Increase the VOlme size without loosing existing Data

--> We can change the volume type from one EBS type to another

	gp2  --> gp3 --> io1 --> st1 

--> We cannot reduce the volume size


Note: 1GB EBS volume of gp2 type is already attached to SERVER1A and it contains 10 files.

1. Login to SERVER1A and observe 10 file already exist in D Drive.

2. Increase the Volume size of the 1GB Volume to 3GB

3. Reduce the EBS volume size from 130GB to 127GB

	NOT POSSIBLE

4. Change the volume type of 130GB Volume from st1 to gp3


NOTE: An EBS Volume cannot be modified more than once in a 6 Hour Window

5. Modify the 3GB Volume (Which is recently modified) again by increasing the size to 5GB and observe we cannot modify and we have to wait for at least 6 hours.


NOTE: Make sure to DELETE all EBS Volumes and EC2 instances to avoid unnecessary charges.
