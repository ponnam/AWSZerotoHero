Simple Storage Service - S3:
----------------------------

--> S3 is AWS managed Highly Available, Highly Scalable Object based storage

--> We can Upload anytype f object into S3, we can share with Anyone.

--> S3 Cannot be used as storage for your EC2 instance

--> S3 doesn't support, operating systems & Software installation.

--> S3 storage is available as Bucket. Bucket is a container in which all the objects will be stored

--> S3 supports unlimited storage, and each object must not exceed 5 TB

--> S3 offers 99.99% Availability.

--> S3 offers 99.999999999 Durability ( 11 9's of Durability)

--> While Creating the busket, we have to assign a name for the bucket. and we must follow naming rules



S3 Bucket Naming Rules:
-----------------------

	- Bucket Name must be unique across all AWS Accounts
	- Bucket Name must be between 3 and 63 characters
	- Bucket name must not Contain Uppercase Characters (ex: A, B, C ..)
	- Bucket name can contain Lowercase characters and Numbers
	- Bucket name must not contain special characters except Period (.) & Dash (-)
	- Bucket name must not looks like an IP Address (ex: 192.168.1.8)
	- Bucket name must start and end with Either lowercase letter or number
	- Bucket name must not contan consecutive periods ( ex: my..s3bucket)



Valid Bucket Names:
-------------------

	mys3bucket
	my.s3.bucket
	my-s3-bucket
	my--s3bucket
	123.mys3bukcet
	mys3bucket1234



Invalid Bucket Names:
----------------------

	.mys3bucket
	Mys3bucket
	my..s3bucket
	mys3bucket-
	123.23.12.98
	mys3.Bucket


--> AWS S3 provides 2 types of S3 buckets

	- General purpose S3 bucket
	- Directory Bucket


Note: Directory buckets can provide single digit milli second latency for object access -- Not recommended for Production/Critical Data.


1. Create S3 bucket in N.Virginia Region with a  name myfirstbucket22feb2025

2. Upload any object into the S3 bucket with all default options

3. Note Down the object url.

https://mys3bucket22feb2025.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test.txt

--> Object url can be used to access the objects, if the object is public.

4. use the object url to access the S3 object, and confirm that the object is private.

NOte: By default, all S3 objects will be uploaded as private objects.



--> We can convert any private object into public as per the requirement

--> ACL can be used to convert any object into publicly readable.

	Access Control List

--> While creating the S3 bucket with all default options, the following setting were configured

	- ACLs Disabled
	- Block all public access - Enabled

--> ACL must be enabled , in order to make any object public.


--> while making the objects public using the ACL, "block all public access" setting will not allow us to make the object public. We must disable "Block all public access"


Note: Disabling "block all public access" will not make your objects public automatically


5. Make the object "Test.txt" as public object

	a) Enable ACL on the S3 bucket
	b) Disable "block all public access" option
	c) Make the object as public.

6. Upload an object as a public while uploading it.
