Note:
-----

Reduced Redundancy Storage - RRS : Noncritical, frequently accessed data with milli seconds access (Not recommended as S3 standard is more cost effective)


--> Storage class is not applicable for the S3 buckets, are for the objects which we store into the S3 buckets.

--> In the Same S3 bucket, we can store multiple objects with different storage classes.

	Object1 --> standard
	Object2 --> standard-IA
	object3 --> OneZone-IA


1. create 7 Text files and upload into the S3 bucket using 7 different storage classes.

2. Access all the objects from AWS Management console and confirm that the "Glacier Flexible retrieval" & "Glacier Deep archive" objects are not available for the immediate access

--> To access the Glacier Objects, we need to initiate a restore request. Then S3 makes the object available to access for a certian period of time.

--> The objects from the Glacier Flexible Retrieval, can be retrieved using 3 Retrieval tier

	Expedited retrieval	--> 1-5 Minutes
	Standard		--> Within 3-5 Hours
	Bulk			--> With 5-12


3. Initiate the Retrieval of the Glacier Flexible retrieval object using Expedited Retrieval


--> the objects from the glacier deep archive, can be retrieved using 2 retrieval tier

	Standard	--> With in 12 hours
	Bulk		--> With in 48 Hours

4. Initiate the Retrieval of the Glacier Deep Archive object using the Bulk retrieval.
