--> S3 offers different types of features, and Static Website hosting is one of those available features.

--> S3 allows you to host a static website without provisioning any Servers or without installing the webserver software

--> S3 doesn't support Dynamic website hosting

--> the website which is designed using the server side scripting, is known as dynamic website

	ex: PHP, javascript etc..
