Life Cycle Rules:
-----------------

--> Life Cycle rule can be used to transition (Move) the objects from one storage class to another storage class after a specific no of days from the data of creation.

--> We can configure the separate life cycle rules for current version & Non-Current version of the objects.

--> We can Configure the object Expiration & Permanent Deletion of the objects

--> Object transition from one storage class to another must be as per the below top down approach

		Standard
		   |
		Standard-IA
		   |
		Intelligent-Tier
		   |
		OneZone-IA
		   |
		Glacier Instant Retrieval
		   |
		GLacier Flexible retrieval
		   |
		Glacier deep Archive


Note: We cannot move the objects from Bottom level storage class to the top level storage class


1. Create  life Cycle rule on S3 bucket as per the below requirement

Current Version:


Standard  -- 30 Days --> Standard-IA -- 60 Days --> OneZone-IA -- 90 Days --> Glacier Flexible Retrieval -- 180 Days --> Glacier Deep Archive -- 365 Days --> Object must be expired (DELETE)


Non-Current Version:

Standard --30 Days --> Glacier Deep Archive -- 365 --> Delete Permanently


Note: We cannot transition the objects from "OneZone-IA" to "Glacier Instant Retrieval"


NOTE:

Default minimum object size for transitioning is 128K
