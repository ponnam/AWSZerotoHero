Pre-Signed URL:
---------------

--> Pre-Signed url is used to share the Private objects in the S3 bucket with any one for a limited time period (ex: 5 mins)

--> While Generating the pre-signed url, we need to configure the TTL (Time to Live - ex: 2 mins). So that the url will expire after the TTL

NOTE:  We don't make any object as a public OBJECT


1. Upload any object in to S3 bucket as a private Object

2. Confirm that the object is not accessible using the Object url.

NOTE: Don't Enable ACL on the S3 bucket

3. Generate Pre-Signed url, to allow the users to access the object for the next 2 minutes only

		TTL = 120 Seconds

4. Verify the Pre-signed url.

5. Wait for 2 mins, and then use the same pre-signed url and confirm that the url EXPIRED.
