Elastic Load Balancer - ELB:
----------------------------

--> Elastic Load Balancer is Highly Available AWS managed service, by using which we can distribute the load across multiple healthy Servers

--> These servers are known as Targets

--> Also We can achieve high Availability using the Load Balancer.

--> In general, All the traffic will be distributed across multiple targets, but whenever any target is Unhealthy then all the traffic will be redirected to the other healthy targets


--> ELastic Load Balancer has 2 Modules

	- Load Balancer
	- Target Group

--> Load balancer receive the request from the users, and it will be forwarded to the target group.

--> Target group is the group in which we register the targets.

--> Target group can distribute the traffic across all the healthy registered targets

--> we can create a health check on the target group to monitor and evaluate the health of the targets

--> By Default, the traffic will be distributed across all the healthy targets using Round Robin Method.


Types of Load Balancers:
------------------------

	- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
	- Network Load Balancer (NLB)
	- Gateway Load Balancer
	- Classic Load Balancer (CLB)


Application Load Balancer:
--------------------------

--> To run Websites or WebApplications on HTTP & HTTPS ports

--> Modern web applications with API and frontend routing

--> Supports Host/path-based routing requirements


Network Load Balancer:
----------------------

--> NLB Supports TCP, TLS and UDP Protocols

--> Ultra-low latency

--> handles Millions of requests per second

--> Load balancing across VPN or Direct Connect links



Gateway Load Balancer:
----------------------

--> Load balances traffic to virtual appliances (firewalls, intrusion detection systems, etc.)

--> Integrates with 3rd party Network security appliances

--> GENEVE Protocol


Classic Load Balancer:
----------------------

--> Legacy ELB Solution

--> Simple Load Balancing for EC2 instances

--> No HTTP/2 support
