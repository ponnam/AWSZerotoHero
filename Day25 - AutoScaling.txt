Auto Scaling:
-------------

--> Auto scaling is feature that automatically adjusts the number of instances or resources within a system based on demand

--> Autoscaling Continously Monitor the application and adjust the capacity to maintain steady and predictable performance with the lowest possible charges.

--> Whenever the load is getting increased, then a new instance will be created in order to increase the total resources and the traffic can be distributed across all the instances.


ScaleUP / ScaleOUT:
-------------------

--> The process of adding a new EC2 instance with respect to the increased load is known as Scale UP. it is also known as Scale Out.

ScaleDown / Scale IN:
---------------------

--> The process of Reducing the Capacity of no of EC2 instances with respect to the reduced load is known as Scale Down. It is also known as Scale In.


Auto scaling Contains 2 Components

	- Launch Template /Launch Configuration
	- Autoscaling Group

--> Launch Template contains the information about how to create EC2 instance

--> Launch template contains the following

	- AMI
	- Instance Type
	- KeyPair
	- Security Group
	- Storage (EBS Volumes)	


--> Autoscaling Group can contain the information about When to create a new Instance and when to delete the existing EC2 instance

	- Launch Template
	- Network (VPC)
	- Availability Zone & Subnet
	- TargetGroup
	- healthCheck Grace Period
	- Group Size
		- Desired Capacity
		- Min Capacity
		- Max Capacity
	- Scaling Policy
		- Target Tracking Policy

	- Instance Warm-up
	- SNS Notification
	- TAGS

NOTE: Launch template is the Latest version for the Launch Configuration, and launch configuration is deprecated


Terminology:
------------

	Min Capacity
	Max Capacity
	Desired Capacity
	Actual Capacity

--> Min Capacity is the no of instances to be running all the time even there is no load

--> Desired Capacity is the required no of instances based on the current load on the application

--> Actual capacity is the no of instances are running at the moment

--> Max Capacity is the maximum no of instances that autoscaling can maintain 


Working Principle:
------------------

	Min Capacity	- 2
	Desired Capacity- 2
	Actual Capacity	- 2
	Max Capcity	- 5


--> If we decided to adjust the capacity  based on the CPU Utilization, then we can set a threshold of "CPUUtilization>70%"

--> Whenever the CPU is more than 70%, then the desired capacity will become +1

	Desired Capacity 	- 2+1 =3

--> But still the actual capacity is 2 only and a new instance wil be created to match the actual capacity with the desired capacity

	Min Capacity	- 2
	Desired Capacity- 3
	Actual Capacity	- 3
	Max Capacity	- 5


--> Whenever the CPUUtilization is less than 70%, then the desired capacity will be -1

	Desired Capcity	- 3-1 =2

	Min Capacity	- 2
	Desired Capacity- 2
	Actual Capacity	- 3-1	= 2
	Max Capacity	- 5


--> Autoscaling is also known as "Horizontal Scaling"
