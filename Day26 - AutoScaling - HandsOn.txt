Auto Scaling Hands-On:
----------------------


1. Create a Target Group "MyTargetGroup

2. Create an Application Load balancer and connect with the above target group.


1. Launch a simple web application using autoscaling feature in order to maintain best performance with lowest charges

	Min Capacity - 2
	max Capacity - 5
	Desired Capacity - 2

	1. Create a Target Group "MyTargetGroup"
	2. Create an Application Load balancer and connect with the above target group.
	a) Create an EC2 instance and host a simple website, and create an AMI

	b) Create a Launch Template "MyLaunchTemplate"

		- AMI
		- Instance Type
		- KeyPair
		- Security Group (22, 80, 443)
		- Storage (EBS Volume)
	
	c) Create Autoscaling Group "MyASG"

		- Launch Template
		- Network 
		- Availability Zone & Subnet
		- Target Group
		- HealthCheck Grace Period
		- Group Size
			- Desired Capacity
			- Min Capacity
			- Max Capacity
		- Scaling Policy
			- Target Tracking policy

		- Instance Warm-Up
		- SNS Notification
		- TAGS

--> ON EC2 instances, There are 2 types of Monitoring

	- Basic Monitoring
	- Enhanced / Detailed Monitoring

--> Basic Monitoring collet the information every 5 mins, where as the detailed monitoring collect the information every 1 min.


--> On the Target group of the Load Balancer, there is a component called De-Registration Delay.

--> De-Registration delay is the wait time to remove (De-register) the target from the target group

--> ByDefault, the de-Registration delay is 300 sec. whenever we de-register the target it will wait for 300 seconds and existing users will be moved to the other targets and the the target will be removed from the target group.


--> We can Modify the de registration delay as per our requirements

3. Modify the De-Registration Delay to 60 seconds to avid the wait time


--> The instance which is close to the next billing hour, will be deleted first by autoscaling group




--> Autoscaling Supports Multiple types of Scaling POlicies

	- Target Tracking Scaling Policy
	- Scheduled Scaling
	- Predictive Scaling
	- Manual Scaling


Schedule Scaling:
-----------------

--> We can schedule the instance creation and deletion at a specific point of time

--> If we know that every day at 06:00 AM we need 4 instance until 5 PM, and from 5PM to next day morning 06:00 AM 2 Instances are enough. This requirement can be fulfilled using the scheduled scaling.


Predictive Scaling:
-------------------

--> Based on the previous Usage/Requirements, auto scaling can predict how many instances are required in the future and capacity will be adjusted by creating or deleting the instances automatically.


Manual Scaling:
---------------

--> We can adjust the capacity manually by changing the Min, Desired and max capacity values



CLEANUP Autoscaling:
--------------------

1. Delete the Autoscaling Group
2. Delete the Launch Template
3. Delete the Load Balancer
4. Delete the target Group
