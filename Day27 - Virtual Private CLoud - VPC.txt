Virtual Private Cloud - VPC:
----------------------------

--> VPC is a Virtual Isolated Network in the cloud

--> By default, AWS Provides a default VPC in each region at the time of AWS Account creation

--> Default VPC Contains multiple subnets, one in each AZ

--> By default, we can create max of 5 VPC per region, which is a soft limit.


VPC Components:
---------------

	- Network
	- Subnet
		- Public Subnet
		- Private Subnet
	- Internet Gateway - IGW
	- Route Tables
		- Route
	- Bastion Host
	- Network Address Translation - NAT
		- NAT Instance (Outdated)
		- NAT Gateway
	- Network ACL (NACL)
	- VPC Peering


Network:
--------

-->  Network is an isolate logical section to connect all the instances. is also known as VPC.

--> VPC Span across all the AZ of the Region


Subnet:
-------

--> Subnet is a small portion of the network, which exist in a single AZ.

--> By default, we can create 200 subnets per VPC, which can be adjustable as per the requirement


Public Subnet: Is the subnet in which the instance can be assigned with public IP and the instances are accessible from any where across the globe.


Private Subnet: is the subnet in which the instances cant be assigned with Public IP and all the private subnet instances are accessible with in the VPC only.


Internet Gateway - IGW:
-----------------------

--> IGW is AWS managed, Highly Available & Scalable component which can be used to establish the communication between the VPC network and the internet

--> We can attach only 1 IGW per VPC


Route Table:
------------

--> Route Table is a component which is required for the communication.

--> Route table shows the path to reach the destination.

--> Whenever we create a VPC, a default route table will be created and it is known as "Main" route table.

--> New Route table contains a default route, which establish the communication with all the subnets in the same VPC

	Destination				Target
	-----------				------
