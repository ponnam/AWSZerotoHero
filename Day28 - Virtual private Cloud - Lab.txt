1. Create a CustomVPC "MyFirstVPC" in N.Virginia region as per the Below requirement

	VPC CIDR Range		- 192.168.0.0/16
	Public Subnet CIDR	- 192.168.1.0/24	-	us-east-1a
	Private Subnet CIDR	- 192.168.2.0/24	-	us-east-1b


	a) Create a VPC "MyFirstVPC" with CIDR Range 192.168.0.0/16
	b) Create an IGW "MyFirstVPC-IGW"
	c) Attach the IGW with the VPC "MyFirstVPC"
	d) Create a subnet "Public Subnet" with CIDR Range 192.168.1.0/24 in us-east-1a
	e) Create a route Table "PublicRT" and create an additional route as below

		Destination			Target
		-----------			------

		192.168.0.0/16			local

		0.0.0.0/0			IGW	--> Additional route

	f) Associate the "Public Subnet: with the route table "PublicRT"
	g) Create another Subnet "Private Subnet" with CIDR Range 192.168.2.0/24 in us-east-1b


Note: By default new subnet will be associated with "Main" Route Table which is Private Route table.



2. Create an EC2 instance "Public Server" in public subnet

3. Login to the Public Server

	Public IP	: 54.87.129.20
	Private Ip	: 192.168.1.15
	UserName	: Administrator
	Password	: NkZBw8Y)%a5zE5sq!Sk%FR.*6;2Fgd4f


4. Create an EC2 instance "Private Server" in Private subnet

5. Login to the Private server

	Public IP	: NA
	Private IP	: 192.168.2.75
	UserName	: Administrator
	Password	: IcWRhBlsJTAg%NSOuNGF)sAYFoVDPr2l


Note: To access the Private subnet instances, we need to use a "Bastion Host", also known as Jump Server.
