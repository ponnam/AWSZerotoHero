Network Address Translation - NAT:
----------------------------------

--> NAT is the process of sharing the internet connection with the private subnet or local network

--> NAT will never assign any public IP to the private subnet instances.

--> NAT will never allow any incoming traffic from the outside of the network (From the internet)

--> On AWS we can create 2 types of NAT

	- NAT Instance (outdated)
	- NAT Gateway

NOTE: NAT Instance is an EC2 instance, in which the NAT software is installed and running.


NAT Gateway:
------------

--> It is AWS Managed Highly Available & Highly Scalable NAT Service

--> AWS will maintain the NAT Gateway as Highly available By providing redundant Service if the NAT Gateway Failed

--> Network Bandwidth will be automatically adjusted (Increased or reduced) based on the usage to provide High Performance while using the internet.

--> NAT Gateway is chargeable on per hour basis

--> NAT Gateway requires an elastic IP Address


1. Create a NAT Gateway "MyFirstVPC-NAT" and provide interent access to the private subnet of "MyFirstVPC"

	a) Allocate an Elastic IP Address
	b) Create NAT Gateway using the above EIP
	c) Create an additional route in the PrivateRT as below

	Destination			Target
	-----------			------

	192.168.0.0/16			Local		--> Default Route

	0.0.0.0/0			NAT GAteway	--> Additional Route




2. Cleanup NAT Gateway and all resources

	a) Delete NAT Gateway
	b) Release Elastic IP Address
