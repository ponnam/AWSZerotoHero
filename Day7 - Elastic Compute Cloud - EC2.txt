Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2:
----------------------------

--> EC2 is AWS Higly Available Service, which can offers resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

--> EC2 can provide a Virtual Machine (Server), also known as EC2 Instance

--> AWS uses Virtualization to provide the EC2 Instances.

		- Citrix Xen Server
		- Nitro Based Virtualization

--> EC2 is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which can provide Infrastructure.
	
	- CPU
	- RAM
	- Storage
	- Networking
	- Power Supply

--> Infrastructure will be maintained and managed by AWS.

--> EC2 provides 99.99% Availability

--> EC2 offers the below for Instance Creation

	- Purchasing Model
	- Tenancy Model
	- Instance Family


Purchasing Model:
-----------------

--> EC2 Offers 3 types of Purchasing Models

	- On-Demand
	- Reserved
	- Spot

On-Demand:
----------

--> Is the Flexible Purchasing Model for EC2

--> No Commitment -- we can create and delete the instance at any time and we will be charged only for the tenure we have used our EC2 instance

--> EC2 Instance Capacity (CPU, RAM & Networking) can be resized at any time without any data loss

--> EC2 instances will per charges per hour ( while they are running)

--> No Upfront charges ( No Advance)


Reserved Instances:
-------------------

--> If the Requirement of the EC2 instance is guaranteed for 1 Year or 3 Years, then it is recommended to go for Reserved Instances

--> We have to provide a commitment of 1 Year or 3 Years

--> Irrespective of the Instance usage, AWS will charge you for the committed time duration

--> In the reserved instances, we need to choose a payment plan for the bill payment.

--> EC2 offers the below payment plans

	- No Upfront --> No need to make any advance payment (pay on Monthly)
	- Partial Upfront --> 50% of the total cost of the reserved instance must be paid as advance
	- Full Upfront --> 100% of the total cost of the reserved instance must be paid as an advance 

--> Based on the Term Commitment & Payment plan, you can get upto 70% Discount.

--> During the Committed period you cannot resize the capacity of the instances

NOTE: Reserved Instance offers 2 types

	- Standard	--> We cannot adjust the Capacity of the instances
	- Convertible   --> It will allow you to increase the capacity whenever we need


Spot Instance:
--------------

--> Spot instances offers upto 90% Discount.

--> Spot instances are not recommended for Prod or Development purpose

--> Spot Instances can be offered using the spare resources available on AWS Datacenters

--> Spot instances can be terminated (Deleted) at any time with just 2 minutes notice and all the data will be lost.

--> Spot instances can be used for testing purpose or for the application which can run with interruptions


Tenancy option:
---------------

--> Based on how we place our Instance, there are3 types of Tenancy Models available

	- Shared
	- Dedicated Instance
	- Dedicated Host


Shared:
-------

--> We can share the Physical Server with other customers

--> our EC2 instances are Virtually Isolated, No one can see our data.


Dedicated Instance:
--------------------

--> Every customer will get their dedicated Hardware (storage), so that we cant share the physical hardware with other customers


Dedicated Host:
---------------

--> Dedicate Host will provide a physical server for the requirement.

--> If Your Software license is based on the no of Physical CPU Cores, then we must have a dedicate host to fulfil the licensing requirements.


Instance Family:
----------------

--> AWS EC2 offers Different instance families for different use cases.

	- General Purpose
	- Compute Optimized
	- Accelerated Computing
	- Memory Optimized
	- Storage Optimized
	- HPC - High Performance Computing



General Purpose:
----------------

--> General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources.

Compute Optimized:
------------------
--> Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors.


Accelerated Computing:
----------------------

--> Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs.

--> Accelerated Computing offers GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) in the instance Family, which is recommended for the applications such as

	- Machine Learning
	- 3D Rendering
	- Video Editing Tools



Storage Optimized:
-------------------

--> Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets 

ex: Data Analytics


Memory Optimized:
-----------------

--> Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.


ex: Databases, In-Memory Cache

HPC Optimized:
--------------

--> are designed for compute-intensive high performance computing (HPC) workloads, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), weather forecasting, and molecular dynamics.


--> While Creating the EC2 instance, we have to select the Instance Type to choose the following

	- Instance Family
	- Size of the EC2 instance (Resources)

	ex: t3.micro
	    C7gn.xlarge

	C --> Instance Family
	7 --> Generation
	g --> Processor Type
	n --> Additional Capacity

	xlarge  --> Instance size
